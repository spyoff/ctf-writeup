Try to play it, and found that we play insult vs bot from Curse of the monkey island game.
[game wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Curse_of_Monkey_Island)

We ask or answer question to the bot, that we can check on walkthrough.

However, we only got 1 question/answer on the beginning. Overtime, the question/answer list is increasing, if our answer is correct.

The task runs mainly using websocke on ctf.sharif.edu:4010

Flow found:
00 : we lose, we answer the question from bot
01 : we win, we ask question to bot

Write a python script to automate learning, until eventually we win.
